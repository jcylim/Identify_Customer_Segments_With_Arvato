# Identify_Customer_Segments_With_Arvato
## Background: 
Identify Customer Segments With Arvato is an unsupervised learning project I did for the Unsupervised Learning lesson in Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree program. Its main objective is to first preprocess, feature engineer, and perform dimensionality reduction with PCA to the dataset provided by Arvato Bertelsmann, and then use clustering techniques to analyze and identify the most likely customer segments to be purchasers of products from a mail-order company based in Germany for a mailout campaign.
